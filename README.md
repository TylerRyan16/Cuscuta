## Game Description

Cuscuta is a biopunk rougelike dungeon-crawler, with emphasis on stealth mechanics and intuitive world generation


## Advanced Topic Description

### Networked Multiplayer

 + Each player has a unique carnage bar allowing for more build combinations
 + Procedural rooms are generated based off an average of both players' carnage bars, weighted heavier towards carnage.
 + Teammates must balance between stealth and destruction to maintain a balance in the dangerous dungeon.
 + Dungeons will be harder in co-op mode and therefore require strategy and planning


    
### Procedural Generation

+ Dynamic - Based off the carnage bar, the type of room, enemies, obstacles, etc. will change
+ Replayable - Each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated, making it feel like a new run each time
+ Variable - Automatic balancing between 1-2 players, 2 player runs will have more enemies/difficulty
