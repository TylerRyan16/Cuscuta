## Game Description

Cuscuta is a biopunk rougelike dungeon-crawler, with emphasis on stealth mechanics and intuitive world generation


## Advanced Topic Description

### Networked Multiplayer

 + Each player has a unique carnage bar allowing for more build combinations
 + Procedural rooms are generated based off an average of both players' carnage bars, weighted heavier towards carnage.
 + Teammates must balance between stealth and destruction to maintain a balance in the dangerous dungeon.
 + Dungeons will be harder in co-op mode and therefore require strategy and planning


    
### Procedural Generation

+ Dynamic - Based off the carnage bar, the type of room, enemies, obstacles, etc. will change
+ Replayable - Each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated, making it feel like a new run each time
+ Variable - Automatic balancing between 1-2 players, 2 player runs will have more enemies/difficulty

## Midterm Goals

* Playable Demo
	+ Basic dungeon generation - fluctuating room size & metrics, completely random
	+ at least 1 enemy type
* Rudimentary Multiplayer
	+ Basic two-player connection
	+ Basic synchronization between movement
* Rudimentary Animation/Artwork
* Basic Line-of-Sight Detection

## Final Goals

*  Complete Game
	+ Dungeon generation based on players' carnage bars and location
	+ Tight interplay between generation & multiplayer
	+ At least 4 enemy types
*  Fluid Multiplayer
	+ Movement and monsters must be synchronized
	+ No large room lag
*  Ending, Boss Battle

## Stretch Goals

* Advanced Stealth/Detection System
	+ Ability to escape detection
	+ Ability to distract enemy
	+ Enemies pathfind to player's last known location
* Multiple Characters
	+ Two characters with at least one distinct ability each

## Grade Breakdown (WIP)

* Dungeon procedural generation works as intended: 25%
* Multiplayer connection works as intended: 25%
* Automatic playercount-dependent and carnage-bar-dependent game balancing: 15%
* Working stealth/detection system: 5%
* Additional playable character: 5%
* Fluid movement mechanics: 12.5%
* Final boss battle: 12.5%
