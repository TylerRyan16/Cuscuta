## Game Description

Cuscuta is a biopunk rougelike dungeon-crawler, with emphasis on stealth mechanics and intuitive world generation


## Advanced Topic Description

### Networked Multiplayer

 + Each player has a unique carnage bar allowing for more build combinations
 + Procedural rooms are generated based off an average of both players' carnage bars, weighted heavier towards carnage.
 + Teammates must balance between stealth and destruction to maintain a balance in the dangerous dungeon.
 + Dungeons will be harder in co-op mode and therefore require strategy and planning


    
### Procedural Generation

+ Dynamic - Based off the carnage bar, the type of room, enemies, obstacles, etc. will change
+ Replayable - Each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated, making it feel like a new run each time
+ Variable - Automatic balancing between 1-2 players, 2 player runs will have more enemies/difficulty

## Midterm Goals

* Playable Demo
	+ Basic dungeon generation - fluctuating room size & metrics, completely random
	+ at least 1 enemy type with basic movement (basic, non-player oriented)
* Rudimentary Multiplayer
	+ Basic two-player connection - Not lag free, just able to have 2 players in same game
* Rudimentary Animation/Artwork
* Basic Line-of-Sight Detection for 1 enemy type

## Final Goals

*  Complete Game
	+ Dungeon generation based on players' carnage bars and location - Should be random, but influenced by carnage bars and player count
	+ Tight interplay between generation & multiplayer - 2 players mean more difficult rooms, some rooms require teamwork to complete
	+ At least 4 enemy types 
	+ At least 3-4 distinct items player can utilize (At least 2 weapons, 1 buff)
*  Fluid Multiplayer
	+ Movement and monsters must be synchronized 
	+ No large room lag
	+ Movement must be relatively lag-free
*  Ending, Boss Battle
	*  Boss has at least 2 unique abilities
	*  End reward

## Stretch Goals

* Advanced Stealth/Detection System
	+ Ability to escape detection
	+ Ability to distract enemy
	+ Enemies pathfind to player's last known location
* Multiple Characters
	+ Two characters with at least one distinct ability each
